[*SparkFun Venus GPS with SMA Connector (GPS-11058)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11058)

This is the latest version of our Venus GPS board; the smallest, most powerful, and most versatile GPS receiver we carry. Itâ€™s based on the Venus638FLPx, the successor to the Venus634LPx. 
The Venus638FLPx outputs standard NMEA-0183 or SkyTraq Binary sentences at a default rate of 9600bps (adjustable to 115200bps), with update rates up to 20Hz! 
The Venus638FLPx also allows for limited on-chip logging (check out the firmware below), as well as external logging using a SPI flash memory chip (not included).
